# MotionSupport

This is a very small library that sits loosely on top of BubbleWrap to extend the core RubyMotion classes, i.e. no user interface classes. It is somewhat inspired by ActiveSupport, but right now, not a lot is implemented.

To see what's there, look into the lib folder. There is documentation, also most everything is tested.

# Differences to ActiveSupport

* Lots of stuff missing
